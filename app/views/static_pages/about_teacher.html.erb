          When Ashleyâ€™s first daughter was 5 months old and still waking up four times per night, Ashley began a desperate search for answers. She read every book, every blog, and every comment posted. At 6 mo, she nursed twice overnight. By 9mo, she could sleep 7pm-7am waking once at 5am to breastfeed. Sleeping through the night (STTN) happened at long last one year and one month after the birth! Her second baby was STTN by 9mo.

         She understands the impact of a good night's sleep on your family's well-being, and also appreciates how important it is to find gentle approaches to get there. Ashley is honored to be part of your journey into parenthood.
